  <h2>Board Game Facts</h2>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Wanting to dive into a game that spans multiple days or just relax and play a fun 20-30 minute game? Well board games is where that can happen. Board games can range in a multitude of styles to play. Some have a card based way of playing, other use dice to move around a board and to deal damage to player or NPCs (Non-playable Characters), or have you move pieces in an orderly fashion. Like card games, board games have been around for thousands of years and originated in Egypt.  </p>

  <p> &nbsp;&nbsp; Along with card games, board games are a big part of our special event nights and demos. Our News and Events page will have a list of events or demos that are coming up to allow people to try out new games or test their skills against each other and staff members. Usually we will have two or three genres per week and will rotate back to the same grouping every four to five weeks. The games will be different but the play style and genre will stay the same week to week. To check out our stock please click on the "Purchase Games" tab to the left to explore all the possibilities that await you. </p>
