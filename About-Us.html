  <h2>Who/What is DerkVanHueberton Gaming?</h2>
  <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here at DerkVanHueberton Gaming we want new and experienced gamers to enjoy their genre of gaming and procure the tools they need to be successful and have a great time. The name DerkVanHueberton Gaming came about when I was in the US Navy and started to game with my wife, my best friend in the Navy, my father and my brother-in-law. </p>
  <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, we decided we wanted to try streaming our games. We all needed to come up with a streaming name for ourselves. I then proceded to come up with the idea to use one of my nicknames growing up, Derk, and one of our cat's name, Huebert. This resulted into a mesh of the two to get DerkVanHueberton.</p>
  <h3>Services we provide to all gamers:</h3>
  <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our company aims to provide everything from general gaming questions, to the games themselves, and even selling gaming setups and other devices to enhance your experience. You will be able to explore four main categories/genres of gaming and learn more about each of them. Once you've decided on a genre you will travel to a page dedicated just specifically to that genre. From there you will get a more in-depth look into what experience you can expect while playing a game in this genre. Once you're read up and seen possible experiences, you can travel to a catelog of games, tools, or full setups that are available for purchase.</p>
