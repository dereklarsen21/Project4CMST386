  <h2>Card Game Facts</h2>
  <p> &nbsp;&nbsp; Want to fake out your opponents without them seeing what you have or build a deck to wipe out your friends? Then card gaming is just for you. Starting back in the 9th Century, in China, people began to decorate paper to create playing cards. Nowadays there are thousands upon thousands of different games that also may include the use of dice and span across many genres. Strategy, deck building, adventure, deception and more are just some of the more familar genres to play.  </p>
