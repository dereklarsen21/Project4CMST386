  <h2>What is the importance of responsive design and its impact on target audiences?</h2>
  <p> &nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, the importance of responsive design is to give the user a pleasant experience while using your website. It is the ability of your application or website to respond to the devices orientation, screen size and behavior. Such things as CSS media queries or having a flexible grid layout allow for your site or app to alter it's layout properly. Its impact on a target audience is vast because you don't want people to have to keep adjusting their screen size or orientation just to be able to click on a button or view information.</p>
  <h3>Per Google Analytics these are three kinds of reports that will allow you to see what information your target audience is accessing:</h3>
  <p> &nbsp;&nbsp; The first kind of report is the Active Users report. Having this report will allow you to see the foot traffic on your site over many different time lengths like 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, or a month. You can view the numbers to determine if your promotional campaigns have paid off or if you have maybe missed the mark somewhere and aren't having a continuous flow of traffic.</p>
  <p> &nbsp;&nbsp; A second report used to see what the target audience is accessing is User Explorer report. Here we can see individual reports of a user and not just a pool. With this report you will see how long their sessions are, bounce rate, revenue, transactions and goal conversion rate. User explorer reports will further inform you of what strategies may or may not be working to sell the user on a product or service.</p>
  <p> &nbsp;&nbsp; The last report I chose to discuss is Demographics reports. From age ranges to gender breakdown you can get a grasp of what kind of traffic your site is bringing in and if you need to adjust something to fully target your main target audience. For example age groups can be broken up into categories like 18-25, 26-35, 36-45 and so on. If your site is suppose to be geared more towards one gender but it turns out you aren't getting much difference between them, then you may have to adjust marketing strategies or the design of the website to draw that audience in.</p>
