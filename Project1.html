<h3>How Do Search Engines work?</h3>
<p>The way a search engine works is a user will type into a search box words for a problem they may have or to look up information about a place. The engine then sends out "bots" that quickly scan across the web for the most relevent sites to what the input was from the user.</p>
<h3>Why are Keywords and Descriptions Important as Meta Tags?</h3>
<p>The main importance of keywords and descriptive text as meta tags is it allows search engines to read the tags in order to find relevent pages based on your input. Basic and more generic words will be easier for people to find your website but can be an issue if there are hundreds of thousands of similar sites. Therefore, one should have some that might be very focused down to something very specific that you have on your site.</p>
<h3>Four Elements that Comprise Writing Relevant Content Links.</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Anchor text</li>
	<li>Use Discriptive words relevent to your page.</li>
	<li>Don't over optimise links with extra wordage.</li>
	<li>Place links in appropriate locations.</li>
</ul>	
<h3>What Constitutes Good Heading Hierarchy?</h3>
<p>The main aspect of Heading Hierarchy is to break up the page in a way that has the more important and most relevent information under the higher heading. For example, you want the title of your company to either be a h1 or h2, whereas an article title on the webpage could be a h3 or h4 depending on how important you deem it.</p>
