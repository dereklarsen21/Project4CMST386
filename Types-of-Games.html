  <h2>Card Games</h2>
  <p> &nbsp;&nbsp; If you were to ask someone to play a card game the most likely response would be to play Uno, Spades, or Poker. However there are many other types of cards games. Some of these include card deck-building, trivia, or fun judging style. To learn more and/or purchase games or add-ons, click the link on the left navigation bar to go to the Card Games page.</p>
  <h2>Board Games</h2>
  <p> &nbsp;&nbsp; Board Games have been around for a very long time, just like card games. Today, the amount of board games you can find and the different play styles are almost limitless. Some of the variety of play styles they come in are role-playing, strategy-focused, roll-and-move, drafting or Wargames. To learn more and/or purchase games or add-ons, click the link on the left navigation bar to go to the Board Games page.</p>
  <h2>Video Games (Consoles)</h2>
  <p> &nbsp;&nbsp; Gaming electronically has only been around for the past 70 or so years but is how most people play games now. They can be either played on a console, a mobile "console", or a PC. Console gaming has allowed people to get together and use a handheld controller to accomplish tasks. Some examples of play styles are taking down bad guys in shooters or playing classic card/board games or even creating your own characters and go on adventures. If console gaming caught your eye or wanting to learn more and/or purchase games or add-ons, click the link on the left navigation bar to go to the Video Games (Consoles) page.</p>
  <h2>Video Games (PC/Laptop)</h2>
  <p> &nbsp;&nbsp; Along side console gaming, PC gaming has controlled the gaming world in a few key areas. Graphics and speeds of running the software have been higher on a PC than a console. If you are willing to pay a little extra and have a larger space for a screen, mouse, keyboard and a tower then you will see the results. Games that are on consoles are usually always released for PC as well but not the other way around. If PC gaming has caught your attention or to learn more and/or purchase games or add-ons, click the link on the left navigation bar to go to the Video Games (PC/Laptop) page.</p>
